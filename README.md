# 📊 User Activity Analysis (Google Sheets Project)

> "Data is not just numbers, it's a story waiting to be told."

## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user activity data using Google Sheets.  
It offered an opportunity to explore core analytical methods in a spreadsheet environment without relying on advanced programming tools.  
Key aspects include user engagement analysis, cohort tracking, and trend forecasting.

## 📂 Dataset
The analysis is based on sample user activity data.  
Data preprocessing, pivot tables creation, cohort analysis, and visualization were performed directly within Google Sheets using built-in functionality.

## ✨ Key Features
- Calculation of central tendency measures (mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range, percentiles)  
- Daily Active Users (DAU), Weekly Active Users (WAU), and stickiness (DAU/WAU) metrics analysis  
- Forecasting future DAU and WAU trends based on historical data  
- Cohort analysis to track user retention over time  
- Visualization of user trends and key metrics through charts in Google Sheets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Google Sheets** (Formulas, Pivot Tables, Charts)
